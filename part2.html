<P><li>In today's ever-changing and unpredictable world, it can be easy to get caught up in short-term concerns and lose sight of the big picture. Leaders who maintain a long-term perspective can stay focused on their core mission, values and vision to ensure that their organizations remain aligned
with future goals and objectives. A long-term perspective is essential for success, especially when leading an organization through uncertain and rapidly changing times.
Take, for instance, the global pandemic. Maintaining a long-term perspective was crucial for keeping calm and ensuring business progress. Leaders needed to continue 
pursuing their mission and remain committed to the organizationâ€™s strategic goals despite the tremendous upheaval in everyday life.</P></li></UL>
